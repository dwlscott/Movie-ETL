The efforts that were made to the original data set. Did not go un-looked. In fact amazon prime likes the data set and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. The new challenge is to create an automated pipeline. That will essentially take in new data, and perform transformations and load the data into the existing table. In order to do that, a few things need to happen. Which include refactoring the original code to create one function, that will take in all three of the data sets. Perform the ETL process and add them to the PostgresQL database.
